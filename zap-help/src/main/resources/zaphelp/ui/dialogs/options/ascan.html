<H1>Options Active Scan screen</H1>
<p>
This screen allows you to configure the <a href="../../../start/concepts/ascan.html">active scan</a> options:

<H3>Number of hosts scanned concurrently</H3>
The maximum number of hosts that will be scanned at the same time.
Increasing this may put extra strain on the computer ZAP is running on.

<H3>Concurrent scanning threads per host</H3>
The number of threads the scanner will use per host.<br>
Increasing the number of threads will speed up the scan but may put extra strain on the computer ZAP is running on and the target host.

<H3>Delay when scanning in milliseconds</H3>
The delay in milliseconds between each request.<br>
Setting this to a non zero value will increase the time an active scan takes, but will put less of a strain
on the target host.

<H3>Handle anti CSRF tokens</H3>
If this option is selected then the active scanner will attempt to automatically request 
<a href="../../../start/concepts/anticsrf.html">anti CSRF</a> tokens when required.<br>
Note that this is experimental functionality and will slow down the scanning process as only one thread will be used to ensure
that anti CSRF token requests dont get out of step.

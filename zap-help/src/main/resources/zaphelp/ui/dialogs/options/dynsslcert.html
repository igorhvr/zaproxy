<H1>Option Dynamic SSL Certificates</H1>
	<p>
	OWASP ZAP allows you to transparently decrypt SSL connections.
	For doing so, ZAP has to encrypt each request before sending
	to the server and decrypt each response, which comes back.
	But, this is already done by the browser.
	That's why, the only way to decrypt or intercept the transmission,
	is to do a 'man in the middle' approach.
	</p>


<H2>Overview</H2>
<p>
	<img alt="man in the middle" src="../../../images/maninthemiddle.png">
</p>
<p>
	In short words, every data send to and received from the server
	is encrypted/decrypted by using the original server's certificate
	inside ZAP. This way, ZAP knows the plain text.
	To establish a SSL protected session from you (your browser),
	ZAP is using it's own certificate. This is the one you can create.
	Every certificate created by ZAP will be signed for the same
	server name. In the example above, ZAP will create a certificate
	for the server's name "www.example.com". This way, your browser
	will do regular SSL encryption.
</p>


<H2>ZAP Root CA certificate</H2>
<p>
	Imagine your're visiting multiple SSL protected sites. Every time your
	browser connects such a site, a new SSL certificate is created.
	But, these certificates are not trusted by anyone (because self created by ZAP).
	In other words, your browser will not accept such certificates in the first place.
	You may familiar with such situations, when your browser complains certificate
	error but you manually can create an exception rule for that server.  
</p>
<p>
	Every certificate created by ZAP is in the direct chain of trust
	from the "ZAP Root CA" certificate. 
	(For more details about chain of trust, use your favorite search engine ;-) )
	This means, you (your browser) only have to trust the ZAP Root CA once,
	and any further certificates are automatically trusted. In other words,
	once you've added the ZAP Root CA certificate to your list of trusted
	Root CAs, your browser doesn't recognize the man in the middle. 
</p>

<h3>Generate</h3>
<p>
	If you're running ZAP the first time, you should generate a Root CA certificate first.
	Once you've generated one, you have to install it within your browser 
	or HTTP client application. See section <a href="#install">installation</a> 
	for more details.
</p>
<p>
	Every generated Root CA certificate is valid for one year. After that period you have
	to create a new one.<br>
	Every generated Root CA certificate is 2048 bit strong (RSA with SHA1).<br>
	Every generated Root CA certificate starts with serial number "1". 
	Every generated Root CA certificate consists of the following identifiers:
</p>
<p style="padding-left: 20pt;">
	<code>
	CN = OWASP Zed Attack Proxy Root CA<br>
	L = 87b77fe834b0a301<br>
	O = OWASP Root CA<br>
	OU = OWASP ZAP Root CA<br>
	C = XX<br>
	</code>
</p>
<p>
	As you can see, there's a Location identifier (L) which is only a hexadecimal number.
	This number is constructed out of two 32bit hash codes: user's name and user's home directory.
	This way you can identify your own certificate when using multiple installations.
	But there's no way, that anyone can figure out your name from this hash code.
</p>

<h3>Import</h3>
<p>
	When you're using multiple ZAP installation and you want to use the same
	Root CA certificate, so you can import it. Simply use one installation of OWASP ZAP
	to generate one Root CA certificate.
	Copy the file 'OWASP ZAP/config.xml' from your users home directory to 
	the PC, where you want to use the same certificate and press 'import' to import it.
	It's only allowed to import from different ZAP configuration files (config.xml), but not
	from self created or exported .CER files.
</p>

<h3><a name="view">View</a></h3>
<p>
	In the options dialog of ZAP you're seeing the raw bytes (hexa-decimal encoded)
	of the certificate. The option "view" tries to use your system's default
	viewing tool for ".CER" files. On Windows, this is typically the same,
	when exporting the certificate and double clicking on it.
</p>

<h3>Save/Export</h3>
<p>
	In the options dialog of ZAP you're seeing the raw bytes (hexa-decimal encoded)
	of the certificate. Many programs are using this simple format for import/export
	functions. When clicking 'export', these bytes are saved to disk.
	This is equal to selecting all and doing CTRL+C (copy to clipboard) and
	save it into a new .CER file (which is simple text as you see in the dialog).
</p>

<h2><a name="dynamic_certificates">Dynamic certificates</a></h2>
<p>
	Each ZAP instance is using it's own root certificate. Of course, you can
	import root certificates, to use them on multiple machines.
	When running, there will be sub-certificated created, each time a HTTPS 
	resource is requested.
	That means, the Root CA certificate is used as an issuer.
</p>
<p>
	Every dynamically generated certificate is valid for 1000 days.<br>
	Every dynamically generated certificate is 1024 bit strong (RSA with SHA1).<br>
	Every dynamically generated certificate has a random serial number. 
	Every dynamically generated certificate consists of the following identifiers:
</p>
<p style="padding-left: 20pt;">
	<code>
	CN = www.example.com<br>
	E = owasp-zed-attack-proxy@lists.owasp.org<br>
	C = XX<br>
	O = OWASP<br>
	OU = Zed Attack Proxy Project<br>
	</code>
</p>
<p>
	<i>
		Side note:
		Each time you start ZAP, internally a random serial number offset is generated.
		Every dynamically generated certificate will use this offset plus an
		increasing counter. For example, first dynamically certificate has 
		serial number 2314, the second one 2315, the third one 2316 and so on.
		The reason for this is simple: browsers are also caching certificates.
		When you restart ZAP but don't restart your browser, it could happen,
		the the browser sees the same certificate but with different serial number.
		In the end, the browser would complain about and reject the certificate.
		By using the random offset (internally 48bit random number), the chances
		are 1 to 281.474.976.710.656 that when restarting ZAP, the serial number
		offset is a different one.<br>
		So in the rare case, you are discovering that you browser complains about
		a broken serial number within the certificate, just restart your browser ;-)

<h2><a name="install">Install ZAP Root CA certificate</a></h2>
<p>
	Any HTTPS client you want to use, has to know the OWASP Root CA certificate
	as 'trusted root certificate'. Typically you have to install manually the
	ZAP certificate into your browser's list of trusted root certificates.
</p>
<h3>Windows / Internet Explorer</h3>
<p>
	The easiest way is to click on <a href="#view">view</a> and choose
	'Install certificate'. Alternatively, you can save/export your generated
	certificate (copy it to you target computer) and double click the .CER file. 
	When doing so, the regular Windows wizard for certificate installation
	assistance is poping up.
	In the this wizard manually choose the certificate store. Do NOT let
	Windows choose automatically the certificate store.
	Choose 'trusted root certificates' as store and finalize the wizard.
</p>
<p>
	After successfully installation, you can check the certificate.
</p>
	<ol>
	<li>Go to Internet options</li>
	<li>Tab Content</li>
	<li>Click certificates</li>
	<li>Click tab trusted root certificates</li>
	<li>The OWASP ZAP Root CA should be there</li>
	</ol>

<h3>Mozilla Firefox</h3>
<p>
	Firefox is using it's own certificate store. Thats why you have to
	import it twice, when you're using both browser on windows.
	Installation and late on validation is done in the same preferences dialog:
</p>
	<ol>
	<li>Go to Preferences</li>
	<li>Tab Advanced</li>
	<li>Tab Cryptography/Certificates</li>
	<li>Click View certificates</li>
	<li>Click tab Trusted root certificates</li>
	<li>Click Import and choose the saved <tt>owasp_zap_root_ca.cer</tt> file</li>
	<li>In the wizard choose to trust this certificate to identify web sites (check on the boxes)</li>
	<li>Finalize the wizard</li>
	</ol>

<H2 style="color: red; font-weight: bold; text-decoration: underline;">Risks</H2>
<p>
	<b>Attention, there are risks!</b><br>
	When adding self generated Root CA certificates to your list of trusted 
	root certificates, everyone with the root certificate can smuggle data
	into your system (browser).
	In other words when you're not testing in a safe environment, but on
	productive machines, be aware that you're opening an additional attack
	vector to your system.

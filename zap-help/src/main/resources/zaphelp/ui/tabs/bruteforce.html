on any of the sites that have been accessed.<br> 
<br>
Sites can be selected via the toolbar or the <a href="sites.html">Sites tab</a>.<br>
Any sites that have have been are are currently being scanned are marked in bold in the toolbar Sites pulldown control.<br>
The toolbar provides a set of buttons which allow you to start, stop, pause and resume the scan.<br>

hovering over this value will show a list of the sites being scanned in a popup.

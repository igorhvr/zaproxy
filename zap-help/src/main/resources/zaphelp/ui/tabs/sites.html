<H1>Sites tab</H1>
<p>
The Sites tab shows all of the URLs visited in a tree structure. <br/>
You can select any of the nodes in the tree to display the request and response for that URL 
in the relevant tabs.<br/>
</p>

<H2>Right click menu</H2>
Right clicking on a node will bring up a menu which will allow you to:

<H3>Attack</H3>
The Attack menu has the following submenus:
<H4>Active Scan Site</H4>

<a href="../../start/concepts/ascan.html">active scan</a> of the whole of the site containing the selected node.<br/>
The <a href="ascan.html">Active Scan tab</a> will be display and will show the progress of the scan.<br/>

<H4>Active Scan Node</H4>

<a href="../../start/concepts/ascan.html">active scan</a> of just the node selected.<br/>
The <a href="ascan.html">Active Scan tab</a> will be display and will show the progress of the scan.<br/>

<H4>Spider Site</H4>
This will initiate a 
<a href="../../start/concepts/spider.html">spider</a> of the whole of the site containing the selected node.<br/>

<H3>Exclude from</H3>
This menu has the following submenus:

<H4>Proxy</H4>
This will exclude the selected nodes from the proxy. They will still be proxied via ZAP but will not be shown 
in any of the tabs.<br/>
This can be used to ignore URLs that you know are not relevant to the system you are currently testing.<br/>
The nodes can be included again via the <a href="../dialogs/sessprop.html">Session Properties</a> dialog   

<H4>Scanner</H4>
This will prevent the selected nodes from being actively scanned.<br/>
The nodes can be included again via the <a href="../dialogs/sessprop.html">Session Properties</a> dialog   

<H4>Spider</H4>
This will prevent the selected nodes from being spidered.<br/>
The nodes can be included again via the <a href="../dialogs/sessprop.html">Session Properties</a> dialog   

<H3>Run application</H3>
This menu allows you to <a href="../../start/concepts/invokeapp.html">invoke applications</a> that you
have configured via the <a href="../dialogs/options/invokeapp.html">Options Applications screen</a> which
is also accessible via the 'Configure applications...' submenu.

<H3>Delete</H3>
This will remove the node and all of its children from ZAP.<br/>
However they can be added back in, to prevent this use the 'Exclude from' menus. 

<H3>Break...</H3>
This will bring up a new window which will allow you to set a 
<a href="../../start/concepts/breakpoints.html">break point</a> on that URL.<br/>
The break point is defined via a regular expression. If you visit a URL which matches this 
expression then ZAP will intercept it and allow you to change either the request and/or the
response.

<H3>Resend...</H3>
This will bring up the
<a href="../dialogs/resend.html">Resend dialog</a> which allows you to  
resend the request after making any changes to it that you want to.

<H3>New Alert...</H3>
This will bring up the
<a href="../dialogs/addalert.html">Add Alert dialog</a> which allows you to manually record a new  
<a href="../../start/concepts/alerts.html">alert</a> against this request.

<H3>Show in History tab</H3>
This will show the selected node in the <a href="history.html">History tab</a>.

<p>
ZAP provides an Application Programming Interface (API) which allows you to interact with ZAP programmatically.
</p>
<p>
The API is available in JSON, HTML and XML formats.<br/>
The API documentation is available via the URL http://zap/ when you are proxying via ZAP.<br/>
</p>
<p>
It should be noted that there is minimal security built into the API, which is why it is disabled by default.<br/>
If enabled then the API is available to all machines that are able to use ZAP as a proxy.<br/>
By default ZAP listens only on 'localhost' and so can only be used from the host machine.
</p>

<p>
The API provides access to the core ZAP features such as the 
 <a href="ascan.html">active scanner</a> and <a href="spider.html">spider</a>.<br/>
Future versions of ZAP will increase the functionality available via the APi.
</p>

<p>
The API is configured using the 
<a href="../../ui/dialogs/options/api.html">Options API screen</a>.

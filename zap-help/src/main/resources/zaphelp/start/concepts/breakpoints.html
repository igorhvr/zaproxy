<H1>Break Points</H1>
<p>A break point allows you to intercept a request from your browser and to change it before
is is submitted to the web application you are testing.<br/> 
You can also change the responses received from the application<br/>
The request or response will be displayed in the <a href="../../ui/tabs/break.html">Break tab</a>
which allows you to change disabled or hidden fields, and will allow you to bypass 
client side validation (often enforced using javascript).<br/>
It is an essential penetration testing technique. 
</p>
<p>
You can set a 'global' break point on requests and/or responses using the buttons on the
<a href="../../ui/tltoolbar.html">top level toolbar</a>.<br/>
All requests and/or responses will then be intercepted by ZAP allowing you to change anything before
allowing the request or response to continue. 
</p>
<p>
You can also set break points on specific URLs using the "Break..." right click menu on the
<a href="../../ui/tabs/sites.html">Sites</a> and <a href="../../ui/tabs/history.html">History tabs</a>.<br/>
Only those URLs will be intercepted by ZAP.<br/>
URL specific break points are shown in the <a href="../../ui/tabs/breakpoints.html">Break Points tab</a>

<p>
ZAP passively scans all of the responses from the web application being tested.<br/>
Passive scanning does not change the responses in any way and is therefore safe to use.<br/>
Scanned is performed in a background thread to ensure that it does not slow down the exploration
of an application.
</p>
<p>
In this release ZAP passive scanning is used for automatically adding <a href="tags.html">tags</a>
and raising <a href="alerts.html">alerts</a> for potential issues. 
</p>

<p>
Passive scanning is configured using the 
<a href="../../ui/dialogs/options/pscan.html">Options Passive Scan screen</a>.<br/>
A set of rules for automatic tagging are provided by default. These can be changed, deleted or added to. 
</p>
